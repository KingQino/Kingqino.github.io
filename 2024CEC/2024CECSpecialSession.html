			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>In order to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, many countries have begun to upgrade the energy and related industries. One of the important ways is to replace traditional fuel vehicles by electric vehicles (EVs). Deadlines for banning the sale of fuel vehicles have been set in many places. We can clearly see that the number of EVs is increasing rapidly.</p>
			<p>From the perspective of EV itself, since charging currently is still much slower than refueling, the application of EVs leads to new optimization problems, such as electric vehicle routing problems, electric vehicle charging problems, and electric public transportation scheduling problems. Due to the charging behavior, these problems are usually more complex than their classical ones like vehicle routing problems and arc routing problems.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the increasing usage of EVs requires more charging stations. It also brings a greater load on the power grid than before. Thus, in terms of infrastructure, EVs also present new challenges like charging station locating, sizing, and pricing. To stabilize the power grid load, some scholars have proposed a new strategy that allows EVs to sale electricity back to the grid, which is called Vehicle to Grid (V2G). If many new strategies like V2G are applied, these problems become even more complicated.</p>
			<p>This special session aims to discuss how evolutionary computation can be applied to the optimization or decision-making problems brought by electric vehicles. Meanwhile, we are very interested in the problems that are not widespread today but may be ubiquitous in the future, like V2G. The special session also aims to facilitate communication between engineers in the new energy industry and developers in the EC community to solve EV-related issues.</p>
